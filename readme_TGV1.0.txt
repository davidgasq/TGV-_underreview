The ToulGaitViz application is released as a standalone application. 

This app has been compiled with MATLAB, version R2019a, The Mathworks, USA. 

The app needs the installation of MATLAB Runtime to run. Each version of the MATLAB Runtime is tied to the version of MATLAB.

This script uses MoCap Toolbox function mcreadc3d.m (https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mocaptoolbox).
Details regarding the application and data processing are available in the paper Montané et al. 2023.
